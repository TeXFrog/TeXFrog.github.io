TeXFrog helps cryptographers manage game-hopping proofs in LaTeX. If you have ever maintained a dozen nearly-identical game files by hand, copying lines between them and trying to keep highlights consistent, TeXFrog is meant to solve that problem.

**Key idea:** Write your pseudocode once in a single source file. Tag each line with the games it belongs to using `%:tags:` comments. TeXFrog produces:

- Individual per-game `.tex` files with changed lines automatically highlighted
- Consolidated comparison figures showing multiple games side by side
- An interactive HTML viewer for navigating the proof in a browser

All from that one source file.

TeXFrog currently supports the [`cryptocode`](https://ctan.org/pkg/cryptocode) and [`nicodemus`](https://github.com/awslabs/nicodemus) pseudocode packages, and we are open to supporting others.

## What The Source Code Looks Like

A snippet of the combined source file (`games_source.tex`):

```latex
k \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\                       %:tags: G0-G2
...
y \gets \mathrm{PRF}(k, r) \\                     %:tags: G0
y \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\                       %:tags: G1
y \gets \OPRF(r) \\                               %:tags: Red1
...
c \gets y \oplus m_b \\                           %:tags: G0,G1,Red1
c \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\                       %:tags: G2
```

Lines with no `%:tags:` comment appear in every game. Lines with tags appear only in the listed games. Ranges like `G0-G2` are resolved by position in the game list, so reductions interleaved between games work naturally.

## Requirements

- **Python** >= 3.10
- **LaTeX** — [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (for `pdflatex` and `pdfcrop`)
- **Poppler** or **pdf2svg** — for `pdftocairo` (`brew install poppler` on macOS), or `pdf2svg` as an alternative

LaTeX and Poppler are only needed for the HTML viewer (`texfrog html`). The LaTeX output mode (`texfrog latex`) works with Python alone.

## Installation and Running

Because TeXFrog is still in preview mode, it is not yet available to install via `pip`. You will need to install it by cloning it from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog
cd TeXFrog
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # on macOS/Linux; use .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -e .
```

When you open a new terminal session and want to run TeXFrog, you will need to reactivate the Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd TeXFrog
source .venv/bin/activate    # on macOS/Linux; use .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can `cd` to any directory on your computer and run the `texfrog` command.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to start a new proof is with `texfrog init`. This creates a minimal, runnable proof (`proof.yaml`, `games_source.tex`, and `macros.tex`) with comments explaining each field.

```bash
# Scaffold a new proof in the current directory using cryptocode for pseudocode
texfrog init

# ... or in a new directory
texfrog init mydirectory

# ... or using the nicodemus package for pseudocode
texfrog init myproof --package nicodemus
```

Build it immediately:

```bash
texfrog latex proof.yaml -o /tmp/tf_output
```

TeXFrog also ships with tutorials you can study:

```bash
# Tutorial: IND-CPA proof (4 games/reductions)
texfrog latex examples/tutorial-cryptocode/proof.yaml -o /tmp/tf_tutorial_latex

# Same tutorial using the nicodemus package
texfrog latex examples/tutorial-nicodemus/proof.yaml -o /tmp/tf_tutorial_nic_latex

# Interactive HTML viewer with live reload
texfrog html serve examples/tutorial-cryptocode/proof.yaml --live-reload
```

## Usage

### Scaffold a new proof

```bash
texfrog init [DIRECTORY] [--package cryptocode|nicodemus]
```

Creates starter files in `DIRECTORY` (default: current directory). The `--package` option selects the pseudocode package (default: `cryptocode`). Existing files are never overwritten.

### Validate a proof

```bash
texfrog check proof.yaml [--strict]
```

Parses the proof and runs validation checks (YAML structure, file existence, tag consistency, empty games, commentary references) without generating any output. Prints a summary and exits with code 0 if valid. With `--strict`, exits with code 1 if there are any warnings.

### Generate LaTeX output

```bash
texfrog latex proof.yaml [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
```

Produces per-game `.tex` files, commentary files, a harness file, and consolidated figures. Output goes to `texfrog_latex/` next to the input file by default. See [LaTeX Integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/latex-integration/) for how to incorporate the output into your paper.

### Generate HTML output

```bash
texfrog html build proof.yaml [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
```

Compiles each game to SVG via `pdflatex` and produces a self-contained HTML site. Open `index.html` in any browser. Games are shown side by side with changed lines highlighted, and you can navigate with arrow keys.

### Open in a local web server

```bash
texfrog html serve proof.yaml [--port 8080] [--live-reload]
```

Builds the HTML site, starts a local server, and opens your browser. With `--live-reload`, TeXFrog watches your source files and automatically rebuilds and refreshes the web browser when you save changes.

## Writing a Proof

You need two input files:

- **`proof.yaml`** — declares the list of games and reductions, points to your macro files and source, and optionally specifies commentary, figures, and which pseudocode package to use
- **`games_source.tex`** — the single combined LaTeX source file with `%:tags:` annotations

See [Writing a Proof]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/writing-proofs/) for a full guide, and the [tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/) for worked examples.

## Included Examples

| Directory | Description | Package | Live Demo |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| [Tutorial: cryptocode]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/tutorial-cryptocode/) | Small IND-CPA proof walkthrough (4 games/reductions) | `cryptocode` | [View demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/demos/tutorial-cryptocode/){:target="_blank"} |
| [Tutorial: nicodemus]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/tutorial-nicodemus/) | Same proof using `nicodemus` syntax | `nicodemus` | [View demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/demos/tutorial-nicodemus/){:target="_blank"} |

Comparing the two tutorials side by side shows the syntax differences between pseudocode packages.

## Contributing

TeXFrog is in its early stages and we are actively looking for feedback from cryptographers who write game-hopping proofs. If you try TeXFrog on your own proof and run into rough edges, have ideas for features, or want to contribute code, please open an issue or pull request. Your input will help shape the tool into something genuinely useful for the community.

To set up a development environment:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -q
